# Memory-Swapper
Developed a Verilog-based register file module with integrated FSM control to perform autonomous multi-cycle data swapping between two memory addresses. The design includes configurable 4x1 address/data multiplexers and supports both standard and FSM-controlled operations, demonstrating advanced sequential logic and modular hardware design principles.
